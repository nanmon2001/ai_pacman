# AI Pacman
This is a in-class course project from CSCE 580 Artificial Intelligence I took in University of South Carolina. 
More detail about the course or the project please see: https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/csce580/ 
I believe the original creator of this project is from CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, a course taught in UC Berkerly.
In this project we write code to help pacman reach his goal or achieve high score by implementing basic search algorithms and machine learning algorithms.
The project is divided into serveral stages, where each stage focuses on differnt techniques:
- Project 1: Implementing search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, USC and A* to help pacman find the food.
- Project 2: Implementing minmax, alpha-beta pruning and expectimax to help pacman eat all the foods under the interference of ghost.
- Project 3: Base on Markov Decision Process(MDP) theory to deal with undeterministic situations. Implement machine learning algorithm 
like value iterationby and Q-learning to help pacman finish the game with a high score.
- Project 4: Implement Bayesâ€™ Nets variable elimination and different sampling technique to help pacman make the best guess.  

More information about the project and course is are here: https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/csce580/
I only post .py files with solutions here, to run the game you have to download the main code body thorugh https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/csce580/projects/

### Important
**I believe the copyright of the game itself belongs to US Berkerly, I fill the empty blocks as a pratice in class. 
I publish my solution here just to demostrate what I learn from the course to my potentional employers, 
if it is improper to publish the solutions here, please contact me through mhow@email.sc.edu, thank you!**
